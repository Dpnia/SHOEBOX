\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{eps}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% 1. introduction
\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Many people experience difficulty managing their own shoes in a decent and pleasant form. Especially for the people living alone, keeping shoes clean and sweet smelling becomes a tough task to manage. When it rains, shoes get wet and dirty. Can you imagine the smell and feel of the shoe? Even worse the smell starts from the entrance to the place where you will go to sleep. This is when the actual management features are required.

What if someone or something could take care of my shoes periodically and automatically. If the shoes could be managed regularly with the aspects of humidity, temperature, and sterilization, it will save money and also provide a pleasant day with a cozy footwear. To realize the concepts of taking care of our shoes, we will develop a shoebox which manages shoes condition by controlling humidity and temperature automatically and periodically. 

We are going to use Arduino to support with humidity and temperature recognition by receiving inputs through switches or sensors. Internet of Things (IoT) is also on the base of the idea. The ability to control things (especially shoes in this case) through internet is the main concept we are trying to realize. We are looking forward to create an integrated service tool such as situation awareness, automatic computing, self-growing.

% 2. requirement
\section{Requirement}


\subsection{Optimizing environment function}
When we wear shoes, they easily become in a state of high temperature and humidity which causes the disgusting smell, which is also the best environment for bacteria to grow. As a result, there is a need to control the condition of the cabinet keeping the shoes. To provide an optimized environment automatically and also on user?s demand is the goal. (There is a need for defining optimized temperature and humidity)
\subsubsection{Temperature/Humidity control through electric fan (automatic)}
The sensor receives temperature and humidity as inputs and provides an optimized environment as an output.
\subsubsection{Temperature/Humidity control through ultraviolet lamp (automatic)}
The sensor receives temperature and humidity as inputs and provides an optimized temperature and humidity as output.
\subsubsection{Drying feature (on demand)}
In case the user's shoes get wet by rain or other liquids the user can request for drying will operate (1), (2).
\subsubsection{Sterilization function (on demand)}
In case the user feels the need for sterilization, user can request for this function, which operates (1), (2).
This function (4) differs from (3) in degrees of intensity.
\subsubsection{Deodorization function (on demand)}
In case the user feels the need for deodorization, user can request for this function, which triggers a deodorant to shoot out.
\subsubsection{Deodorization function (automatic)}
The user can set regular intervals to trigger the deodorant to shoot out.
\subsubsection{Intensity control feature}
The user can choose the intensity level of (1), (2). Intensity is calculated as number between 1 to 5.


\subsection{Management function}
Different type of shoes requires different type of proper cares. The shoe rack needs to understand and recognize the shoes type and provide a proper management for the shoes.
(Modeling : changing ambiguous information into actual concept.)
\subsubsection{Shoe categorization function (bar-code scanning)}
Shoe categorization through capturing the barcode for the shoes.
\subsubsection{Shoe categorization function (user input based)}
Shoe categorization through selected category of the user.
\subsubsection{Shoe categorization function (captured image)}
Shoe categorization through captured images of the shoes.
\subsubsection{Shoe categorization function (3D scanning)}
Shoe categorization through 3D scanning of the shoes.
\subsubsection{Setting the proper management tool}
After Shoe categorization, based on the shoes category, the shoe rack provides the proper setting.
(There is a need for defining proper setting for each category)
The proper setting is different in the aspect of the intensity from Optimization environment function.


\subsection{Analysis function}
To keep the user?s shoes in high quality we can provide an analysis for the shoes the user own.
\subsubsection{Absence of shoes analysis (Base information)}
We have decided to analyze the absence of shoes by sensor and use it as a base information for other analysis functions.
\subsubsection{Durability analysis}
Durability is set to decrease by the time the shoe has been put on increases. 
\subsubsection{Life prediction analysis}
Based on the information of (1), we provide the expected  life of the shoes.
\subsubsection{Preference analysis (personal)}
Based on the information of (1) for one user, we provide the preference information of the shoes. More the user put on, more the preference increases.
\subsubsection{Preference analysis (general)}
Based on the information of (1) for a number of users, we provide the preference information of the shoes for general aspect. Using this Big data, the user can know which shoes are popular nowadays.
\subsubsection{Frequency analysis}
Based on the information of (1), we provide the frequency information for the shoes.\subsubsection{Walking habit analysis (health care)}
Based on the information flatness of the shoes , we provide the information about walking habit of the users.


\subsection{Recommendation function}
Smart Shoes cabinet will provide recommendation information with percentages based on different kind of aspects. Of course the final choice is up to the user.
\subsubsection{Recommendation based on weather forecast }
With weather API, the proper type of shoes is recommended.
\subsubsection{ Recommendation based on the use of shoes}
Recommending the shoes type which matches with the user?s activity.
\subsubsection{Recommendation based on the color of shoes}
Recommending the shoes color which balances with the users clothing color.
\subsubsection{ Notice of recommendation rate by color}
Showing the recommendation rate by different colors. For example, if the shoes are recommended, a specific color will appear on the shoe rack or on the screen the user is looking at. 
\subsubsection{Notice of recommendation rate by percentage}
Showing the recommendation rate by percentage. If the shoes are recommended strongly, the percentage will appear on the shoe rack or on the screen the user is looking at. 


\subsection{Notification function}
Shoes easily get dirty, since when people do activities, shoes are the first thing that touches the ground. The shoes cabinet will provide notification for contamination of dirt or rainwater by checking on the weight difference.
\subsubsection{Recognition of contamination by sensor}
With the increased weight, notification is given for contamination.
\subsubsection{Notification for contamination by message}
After the recognition of contamination, the information is notified to the user through messages.


\subsection{Networking / Remote control function (UI)}
Without the function for internet control, it becomes nothing more than a drying machine. With this networking function on the base, the user is able to take care of the users shoes any time, anywhere. This is the most important feature we will concentrate on. Providing the IoT environment is the main goal. 
\subsubsection{Control function through web programming (main)}
With web based program, the user can interact with the smart shoe care software and other provided information.
\subsubsection{Control function through mobile (sub)}
With mobile application, the user can interact with the smart shoe care software and other provided information.
\subsubsection{Control function through embedded system (sub)}
With embedded system, the user can interact with the smart shoe care software and other provided information.

% 3. development environment
\section{Development Environment}

\subsection{Choice of software development platform}
\subsubsection{Platform used for developing}package
 We will use both Windows and MAC OS . Since Windows is the most popular OS used worldwide and MAC OS is the second most popular OS leaving out all the other versions of Windows. We thought MAC OS X will become more popular. We also thought using other OS besides windows will mean a lot for us to use another environment to develop a software.
\\
\subsubsection{Programming language used for developing}
We are using Arduino, mySQL, Ruby and HTML. We are trying to provide a web service with arduino acting inside the Smart Shoebox. The frontend will be using html and css, while the backend will be using ruby and ruby on rails as a application framework. If we think of the server as a localhost, we might be using only ruby and ruby on rails for the server without MySQL.\\

\begin{table}
\renewcommand{\arrayrulewidth}{1pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{3}
\begin{tabular}
{|p{3.5cm}|p{.5\linewidth}|}\hline

Programming language & Reason\\ \hline
Arduino(hardware) &The main hardware part of our project is based on Arduino. The Smart Shoebox has functions to work provide behavioral motions such as recognizing the temperature and humidity of the shoebox, turning on the fan or infrared lamp as a result of it and so on. \\ \hline
MySQL(server side) & We need to have a database to save information about the shoes, users. To easily get and set and manage the information, we have decided to use a database management tool. \\ \hline
Ruby & We first thought of php for the work between the server and web side environment, since we have all learned php in another course. Though we thought it would be much better to learn a new language for this project. Ruby on rails was the interesting programming language in the aspect that it shortens and simplifies the code much more than the php. \\ \hline
HTML5 and CSS3(client side) & We have decided the user interface environment as a web-based structure. The functions of Smart Shoebox will be triggered and managed in the web. \\ \hline

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
