<br><br>
<p>Temperature/Humidity control through electric  fan (automatic)this will provides an optimized environment(through arduino) for all type of shoes</p>
<br>


<p>Drying feature (on demand)
if the user’s shoes get wet by rain or other liquids< you can request for drying will operate

Recommending the shoes color which balances with the users clothing color</p>

</h4>
<br>

<p>Absence of shoes analysis We have decided to analyze the absence of shoes by  pressure sensor and use it as a base information</p><br>
<p>Durability analysis
Durability is set to decrease by the time the shoe has been put on increases. </p><br>
<p> Life prediction analysis
Based on the information of (1), we provide the expected  life of the shoes</p>
